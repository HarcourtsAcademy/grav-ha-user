  - title: What You Will Learn
    list: People learn from books and teachers, videos and programmes but nothing is as effective or memorable as learning from experience. Expert Panel programme panellists include specialists from outside of our industry, experts in finance, marketing, psychology, great CEOs from successful organisations and of course our very own skilled leaders from inside Harcourts.

course_structure: |
  Expert Panels usually comprise of 3 to 4 panelists who will each speak briefly before the facilitator opens up to questions from the floor.

  The courses are are half day sessions at your local Academy training room but can be held off-site at a hired venue when attendee registrations are high.
