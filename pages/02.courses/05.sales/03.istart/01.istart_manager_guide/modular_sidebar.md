## The iStart24 Programme
The iStart24 programme is a six month coaching course for new and existing sales consultants. It is assumed that iStart24 participants have already completed the Harcourts Way Sales Programme and have put in place the initial foundation blocks of their real estate business. This programme is not designed to replace their existing business activities, but rather to take them through the process of an in-depth study of each element of their business and to ensure that by the end of 24 weeks they have all areas of their business in place in a far more comprehensive way.

As their manager your support is essential as your team member works diligently to complete assignments and apply techniques throughout the programme. This includes participating in weekly catch-ups with you to discuss their progress.

## Weekly iStart24 progress reports for Managers
Managers of iStart24 Online participants receive weekly progress report emails that contain a summary of iStart24 tasks completed by the participant during the previous week. Refer to weekly progress reports during your weekly one-on-ones and keep your team accountable to the programme.

The report lists the percentage of 'Topic focus' and 'Success' tasks completed the previous week.

Topic focus tasks relate to that week's iStart24 topic

Success tasks relate to daily, weekly and monthly activities that if done consistently will form foundational habits for success.

## iStart24 Participant Weekly Meetings
These weekly meetings are focused conversations between you and your Sales consultant that are part of the continuous coaching process. The meetings are based on the sales consultant's achievements and challenges experienced each week and allow you the opportunity to focus their energy and assit them to achieve the activities required each week. This repeated activity develops good habits which will form the foundation for their success. Weekly meetings are usually the difference between average and outstanding results.  

### A basic guide for conducting a one-on-one

#### Have an agenda
- Were you able to complete all of the required activities?
- Did anything get in the way of doing what was asked of you?
- Is there anything from this week that you would like to go over with me?
- What, if anything, did you find really valuable this week?
- Can you see benefit in continuing to use the practices discussed this week on an ongoing basis?
- Is there anything else you would like to discuss at this time?

#### Always be on time
These meetings are important to your team member do not under value them. By running late or cancelling you are telling your people they are not important.

#### No interruptions
Close the door to provide privacy and do not allow others to interrupt you. Do not take phone calls or check email.. These gestures are important and tell your people that you value them and respect their time.

#### A written record
Take notes of what you have discussed and refer to these the following week.

### Thank you
Completing iStart24 will require a significant investment of the participant's time over a 24-week period and your assistance will ensure they stay the course.
