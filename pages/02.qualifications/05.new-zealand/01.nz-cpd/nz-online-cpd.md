## Who
The Real Estate Authority (REA) requires every person who holds a current real estate certificate or license to attend ongoing learning every year to remain current in knowledge and skill that ultimately provides consumer protection and a consistently high standard of service for the buying, selling and leasing public.

## What

The REA recognises that continuing professional development is necessary to:
- raise and maintain industry standards
- promote consumer confidence in the real estate industry

The REA has therefore designed a continuing professional development program to improve licenseesâ€™ knowledge of the law, rules and regulations that govern the industry, to understand and uphold the concepts of ethics and professional competence in a real estate context, and to improve their skills and judgement.

Licensees must complete **20 hours** of continuing professional development each year:
* 10 hours **Verifiable** professional development covering industry content and assessment specified by the REA.
* 10 hours **Non-Verifiable** professional development covering general real estate knowledge and skills used in the field.

Note that 20 hours of continuing professional development the Authority requires all licensees to complete is
a **minimum**, not a maximum.

## How
Harcourts can provide all 20 hours
