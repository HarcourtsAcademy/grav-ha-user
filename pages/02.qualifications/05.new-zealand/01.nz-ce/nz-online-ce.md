## Who
The REAA requires every person who holds a current real estate certificate or license to attend ongoing learning every year to remain current in knowledge and skill that ultimately provides consumer protection and a consistently high standard of service for the buying, selling and leasing public.

## What

The Real Estate Agents Authority (REAA) recognises that continuing education is necessary to:
- raise and maintain industry standards
- promote consumer confidence in the real estate industry

The REAA has therefore designed a continuing education program to improve licensees’ knowledge of the law, rules and regulations that govern the industry, to understand and uphold the concepts of ethics and professional competence in a real estate context, and to improve their skills and judgement.

**20 hours** of continuing education is required each year.
* 10 hours **Verifiable** education covering industry content and assessment specified by the REAA.
* 10 hours **Non-Verifiable** education covering general real estate knowledge and skills used in the field.

Note that 20 hours of continuing education the Authority requires all licensees to complete is
a **minimum**, not a maximum.
