[Harcourts Real Estate Training Centre](mailto:help@realestatetrainingcentre.com) offers RTO training to Harcourts team members and the public. It's powered by Harcourts Academy and provied students with the knowledge and skills to demonstrate competency in the required units required for industry registration.

Our RTO courses are assessed entirely online with some face-to-face support options available. Completion of the required units of competency will enable participants to submit their statement of attainment to their local governing body in application to become registered as a real estate salesperson, property manager or auctioneer.
