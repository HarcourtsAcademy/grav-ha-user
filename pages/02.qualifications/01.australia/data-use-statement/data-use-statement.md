- issue a VET Statement of Attainment or VET Qualification, and populate Authenticated VET Transcripts;
- facilitate statistics and research relating to education, including surveys
- understand how the VET market operates, for policy, workforce planning and consumer information; and
- administer VET, including program administration, regulation, monitoring and evaluation.
