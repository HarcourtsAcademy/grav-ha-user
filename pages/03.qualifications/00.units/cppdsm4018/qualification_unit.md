This unit of competency specifies the outcomes required to recognise and analyse property styles and faults in order to assist clients to understand the condition of property prior to listing, leasing or refurbishment. This includes identifying different architectural and construction styles and their impact on the market value of property, using common building construction terms to describe key features of properties, explaining the impact of common building defects on marketing properties for sale or rent, conducting property inspections, presenting reports on the physical condition of properties, identifying costs and potential benefits of property improvements, and acting on subsequent client instructions. This is not expected to replace technical and expert advice nor represent financial advice.
