      The National Certificate in Real Estate (Salesperson) programme in association with The Skills Organisation is completed by correspondence. With classroom-based training there is a teacher on hand to facilitate student learning and assessment and can be completed faster than training by correspondence. However, there are many benefits to training by correspondence, namely:

      * Students can study at any time and at any place. They can maintain a full-time job and complete the programme at home * after work.
      * Students in regional areas, where there are no classroom delivered courses available, have access to the programme.
      * Lower course fees.


      This is a correspondence programme, students must be aware that:

      1. Correspondence training courses take, on average, twice as long to complete as those delivered in the classroom. Students 1. should allow 3-weeks turnaround time after completing each study unit, longer if re-submissions are required.
      2. Guidance is via email, phone and an online support forum. It is essential that students use the online support forum to 1. post any questions.
      3. There is a face-to-face component of the assessment. Please ask the student to contact your local Academy trainer to check for available dates that fit their study time frame before registering for this programme.
