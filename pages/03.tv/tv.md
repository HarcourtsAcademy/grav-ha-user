The Academy provides self-paced and webinar online learning across Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the USA.

===


## Self-paced Online Learning
Self-paced online learning is training that is consumed at your own pace using your own computer. Topics covering business planning and law, ethics and documentation are avilable now. Additional programs are always being developed.

## Webinars
Webinars are live online learning spaces where people meet to receive live training and participate in discussions and presentations.  During a webinar, each participant sits at his or her own computer and is connected to a presenter and other participants over the internet.  Webinars can be one-way, where the audience listens to a presenter, or collaborative, where the audience interacts with the presenter and other participants. Stay current while saving time and money by attending webinar training from your home or office. If you're unable to attend live, you can visit the [HarcourtsOne Library](https://library.harcourts.net/) to watch any you've missed.

## Benefits
Real Estate professionals around the world are benefiting from online learning.  The benefits include:

- No travel time or cost – no need to pay for petrol, parking, accommodation or plane tickets
- Convenience –  learn from the comfort of your home or office
- Stay current – connect with the latest training produced by experienced trainers and industry experts
