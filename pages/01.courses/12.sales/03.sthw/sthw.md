## Program Design

We believe it is critical for learners to be able to recall what was learned, then be able to apply the knowledge in practical situations. This is why learning has been spaced over a 6-12 month period.

#### This program has been designed in 4 stages:

1. Online pre-learning
1. In-class foundational knowledge
1. Online learning when you return to your office alongside coaching with Manager or Business Owner

### Online Learning Modules

Once each module has been completed, you should meet with your Manager or Business Owner to debrief the learning and discuss your progress to date.
