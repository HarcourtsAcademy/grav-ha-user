Our most successful team members are also our most generous when it comes to sharing what they do with others. The Shared Knowledge program is a series of talk and Q&A sessions where we ask a panel of Harcourts top performing sales consultants share their knowledge.

Shared Knowledge workshops usually comprise of 3 to 4 panelists who will each speak briefly before the facilitator opens up to questions from the floor.
