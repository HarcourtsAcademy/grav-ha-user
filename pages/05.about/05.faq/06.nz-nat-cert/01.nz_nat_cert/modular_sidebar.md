The National Certificate in Real Estate (Salesperson) is the new entry level qualification for salespersons. The qualification is made up of 11 unit standards, compared to 6 in the old ‘Salespersons’ Certificate’ qualification.

## How do I register to attend the new salesperson entry level qualification?{#register}

## What employment contracts do our new recruits start on?{#startingcontract}
New recruits that are in the process of completing the National Certificate in Real Estate (Salesperson) are employed on the 'Agreement for Provision of Administration Assistant Services'.

### Harcourts One members
To access a copy of this Agreement go to [National Certificate in Real Estate (Salesperson)](/qualifications/new-zealand/new-zealand-national-certificate) > Agreement for Provision of Administration Assistant Services.

## Why do we use this employment contract?{#employmentcontract}
Our recruits are required to be in employment so that they may have a studycontract with the REAL ITO in order to complete the qualification. Under the Real Estate Agents Act 2008, as the recruits are not licensed sales consultants, they cannot be employed as 'independent contractors' like they were under the RealEstate Agents Act 1976. Recruits will move onto the standard sales consultants 'independent contractor' arrangement once they become licensed.

## What time frame do I allow in Clause 1 of the Agreement for Provision of Administration Assistant Services?{#timeframe}
> *1\. This contract shall commence on ................[Date] and expire on ...............[Date] unless the term is extended by a fresh agreement in writing.*

It is suggested that you allocate three months as this will allow time for both study and the licensing process.

## Do I have to enter an hourly rate as per Clause 3 of the Agreement for Provision of Administration Assistant Services?{#enterhourlyrate}
> *3\. The contract rate applicable to the Services provided under this agreement is $ ……..per hour. If the Contractor is registered for GST and provides a GST invoice, the Company will also pay GST in addition to the contract rate.*

Yes, you are required to enter an hourly rate for the contract to be valid. Choose a minimum wage rate such as $15 per hour.

## Do I have to pay the recruit the agreed hourly rate?{#hourlypayrate}
No, you do not have to pay the recruit because you will make it very clear to the new recruit that your franchise will not be requiring them to provide 'administrative assistant services' as per Clause 2 of the Agreement for Provision of Administration Assistant Services. No services provided means no payment.

> *2\. The Contractor agrees to provide administrative assistant services (“the Services”) to the Company from time to time as agreed between them, depending upon demand for the Services, the availability of the Contractor to provide the Services, and various other contingencies.*
