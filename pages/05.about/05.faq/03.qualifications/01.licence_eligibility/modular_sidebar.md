## Australia
In Australia, to be eligible for a real estate salesperson certificate and licence, you must:

- be 18 years or over
- be a suitable person †
- have completed the required training units through a registered training organisation.

† An individual is considered suitable if they:

- have not been convicted in the previous five years of a serious offence which is punishable by three or more years imprisonment
- are not disqualified from holding a licence or registration certificate
- are not recorded in the register of disqualified company directors under the Corporations Act 2001.

## New Zealand
To be eligible for a salesperson's licence in New Zealand you must:

- be at least 18 years of age
- not be prohibited from holding a licence under section 37 of the Real Estate Agents Act 2008
- be a fit and proper person †
- have a prescribed qualification (Qualifications can be provided by the Harcourts Academy)

† Fit and proper relates to your character and standing in the community. If you have convictions that would make a reasonable person think twice about allowing you access to their property or family, contact the REAA before starting study for a real estate qualification.

A person in New Zealand is ineligible to hold a real estate licence if (amongst other exclusions):

1. They have been convicted, whether in New Zealand or another country, of a crime involving dishonesty (or of a crime that, if committed in New Zealand, would be a crime involving dishonesty) within the 10 years preceding the application for a licence.
2. They have been convicted of an offence under sections 14, 17 to 22, or 24 of the Fair Trading Act 1986, within the five years preceding the application for a licence.
