## Australia
To become a real estate salesperson in Australia you need a Real Estate Salesperson's Certificate. For this you will need to provide your State or region's Real Estate governing body:

1. A Statement of Attainment for required training completed
2. A correctly completed application form
3. Payment of required fees

Harcourts provides you with the required training for you to be a real estate sales person. Upon successful completion of the Harcourts Course you will achieve a Statement of Attainment and we can also assist you to complete the application form.
