- Preparing to Buy
- Your Unique Signature
- Managing Conflict

- Personality Profiles
- PM Routines, Repairs & Maintenance
- Inâ€‘going Tenancies

Programs at some Real Estate training institutions focus on 'what' to know and do. Harcourts Academy programs also focus on 'how' and therefore favour in classroom training delivery where participants can take a more hands-on approach to learning.
