Inherent in the Harcourts culture is the pride with which we are actively involved in the personal and professional development of every member of our team. The Academy offers a unique type of structured course path and tailored system of learning.

Students rave about the difference our training makes and we've captured their comments in [Growing Our People](Harcourts_Academy_Growing_Our_People.pdf). 

> “This programme helped me to understand the fundamentals of real estate and the unique approach Harcourts use with their clients. It was fantastic to be in a room full of dedicated and passionate real estate consultants”
