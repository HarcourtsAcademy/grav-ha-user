Our training is often regarded as setting the benchmark for the entire real estate industry.

===

## It's all about people
Successfully buying and selling real estate is mostly about fulfilling people's needs and aspirations. That's why Harcourts people not only receive in-depth professional training (the benchmark for the industry) but are also committed to building meaningful and genuine personal relationships with their clients. And the huge volume of referrals and repeat business generated is proof that this works to everyone's satisfaction.

Inherent in the Harcourts culture is the pride with which we are actively involved in the personal and professional development of every member of our team. The Academy offers a unique type of structured course path and tailored system of learning.

It is our unparalleled investment in our people which provides rewarding futures for those who are motivated to learn and committed to high levels of personal and professional growth.

## Having the very best people is fundamental to our success

However providing them with the opportunity to be the very best practitioners is equally imperative. The organisation has recognised that a basic human need is growth, both personal and professional. Satisfying this not only delivers on the group's purpose to create success for every individual within the organisation but it also provides a compelling reason for people to stay with the organisation.

We offer a structured career path and tailored system of learning. It ranges from the comprehensive [Sales Programme](/courses/sales/sales-programme) to the full [Leadership Programme](/courses/leadership/leadership-programme).
