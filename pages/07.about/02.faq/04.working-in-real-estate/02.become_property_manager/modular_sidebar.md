## Australia and New Zealand
To become a real estate Property Manager in Australia or New Zealand you need a Real Estate Salesperson's Certificate. For this you will need to provide your State or region's Real Estate governing body:

- A Statement of Attainment for required training completed
- A correctly completed application form
- Payment of required fees.

The Harcourts Academy currently offers a [Property Management Programme](/courses/property-management/property-management-registration) across Australia and New Zealand. Qualifications for Property Management registration can be issued in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. In South Australia, it is not required to obtain a registration to work in the Property Management industry.

### Cost involved

The cost of the Property Management Programme is $1,300. If you secure a position with a Harcourts office prior to attending the training you receive a $1,000 sponsorship from Harcourts, and the cost to you will be $300.
