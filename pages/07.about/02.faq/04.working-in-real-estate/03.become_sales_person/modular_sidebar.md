## Australia
To become a real estate salesperson in Australia you need a Real Estate Salesperson's Certificate. For this you will need to provide your State or region's Real Estate governing body:

1. A Statement of Attainment for required training completed
2. A correctly completed application form
3. Payment of required fees

Harcourts [Sales Programme](/courses/sales/sales-programme) provides you with the required training for you to be a real estate sales person. Upon successful completion of the Harcourts Sales Programme you will achieve a Statement of Attainment and we can also assist you to complete the application form.

### Cost involved
The cost of the Sales Programme is $1,690. If you secure a position with a Harcourts office prior to attending the training you receive a $1,000 sponsorship from Harcourts, and the cost to you will be $690.
